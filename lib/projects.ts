I led a 5-member team to conduct 40+ qualitative ethnographic interviews and co-design sessions, as well as a survey with 1062 responses. User research insights highlighted the difficulty of accurately conveying emotion through text, without the help of body language and expressions, leading to miscommunication.\n\nWith this learning, I developed product vision and a 1-year roadmap for AI content generation features based on user insights. The strategy focused on messaging centered around tone and emotion, high-quality generations that fit usersâ€™ mental models, and balancing user agency with proactive nudges that match user intention. The proactive AI nudges are also powered by an intention-detection ML model.",
